According its usage, your task is to encapsulate them into well-structured Python functions, along with a testing instance to demonstrate how to call these functions.

Your encapsulated functions should follow these key points:
1. Self-Contained: Each function must handle the API request (including making the call and processing the response) and return the result. All required constants, such as `BASE_URL` and `headers`, must be included within the function itself, rather than relying on external, global variables, or function arguments.
2. Function Flexibility: Ensure the function is flexible enough to accept necessary parameters based on the APIâ€™s requirements and return structured results (such as JSON responses). The parameters should adapt dynamically depending on the user's query.
3. Error Handling: The function should be robust enough to handle HTTP request errors. This includes checking for unsuccessful status codes or managing exceptions, and faithfully returning the error message or exceptions information. BUT do not print anything inside the function.

Here is an output template. Please include the function and the testing instance using the following format.
{self.begin}
import requests # import necessary lib

def API_NAME(PARAMs: type):
    \"\"\"
    Description: add the description of the functionality
    Args:
    - PARAM 1 (type): explain the params
    - ...
    \"\"\"
    # define the variable constants, like header or base url 
    ...
    # request get/post/...
    ...
    # Error Handling for state code
    ...
    return response

# begin your testing instance
